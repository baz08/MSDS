## R Markdown
In this markdown we explore the Dataset regarding New York shooting incidents. We begin by reading the data in as a csv file, tidy the time date format, sort and order, and filter the exact information that we wish to see,

```{r cleaning}



ny_cases <- read_csv("https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/833y-fsy8/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD")

ny <- ny_cases %>%
  rename(DATE = 'OCCUR_DATE', TIME = 'OCCUR_TIME') %>%
  mutate(DATE = mdy(DATE))


ny<- ny[order(ny$BORO), ]

ny<- ny %>%
  select(DATE:VIC_RACE) %>%
  mutate(death = as.numeric(ny$STATISTICAL_MURDER_FLAG), 
                            YEAR = as.numeric(format(ny$DATE, "%Y"))) %>%
  select(-c(LOC_CLASSFCTN_DESC, LOCATION_DESC, LOC_OF_OCCUR_DESC, JURISDICTION_CODE,
            PERP_SEX, PERP_AGE_GROUP, PERP_RACE, PRECINCT))
ny
```

Here, we have a Dataset where we have the data ordered by boro, and the deaths has been changed to a numeric format in the column "death". The year is extracted from date to the column "YEAR" and all other unnecessary variables are dropped. Following this, we continue to mutate columns to analyze the cases to death ratio and the yearly count of each. 

```{r analyzing}



ny<- ny %>%
  group_by(YEAR)%>%
  mutate(cases_per_year = n())



ny_by_year <- ny %>%
  group_by(YEAR)%>%
  reframe(death = sum(death), cases_per_year = cases_per_year)%>%
  mutate(deaths_per_year = death, rate_death = death/ cases_per_year)%>%
  select(deaths_per_year, YEAR, cases_per_year, rate_death)%>%
  ungroup()
  
ny_by_year <- unique(ny_by_year)

ny_by_year
```


Here we have a cleaned Dataset demonstrating the yearly count for deaths and cases, as well as the rate of death for interest's sake. The data is then visualized in the following, plotting the deaths per year. 


```{r year visualization}
ny_by_year%>%
  ggplot(aes(x= YEAR, y = rate_death)) + 
  geom_line(aes(color= "rate_death")) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = "rate_death")) + 
  scale_y_log10() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
   labs(title = "Deaths in New York by Year", y = NULL)

```

Further diving into our data, we group the information by boro to find the yearly deaths and cases per Boro.


```{r by_boro}
ny_by_boro <- ny %>%
  group_by(BORO, YEAR) %>%
  mutate(cases_per_year = n())

ny_by_boro <- ny_by_boro %>%
  group_by(BORO, YEAR) %>%
  reframe(death = sum(death), cases_per_year = cases_per_year)%>%
  mutate(D_per_BORO = death, rate_death = death/ cases_per_year)%>%
  select(D_per_BORO, BORO, YEAR, cases_per_year, rate_death)%>%
  ungroup()



ny_by_boro <- unique(ny_by_boro)

ny_by_boro

```

We take the cleaned data and visualize the information for the yearly death rate between boros.


```{r Boro visualization}
  
ggplot(NULL, aes(x = YEAR, y = rate_death))+
    geom_line(data = ny_by_boro, aes(x = YEAR, y = rate_death,
                                     color = BORO, group= BORO))+
    geom_line(data=ny_by_year, aes(color = "AVERAGE")) +
    scale_color_brewer(palette="Accent")+
    scale_y_log10() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
   labs(title = "Deaths per BORO", y = NULL)
```
```{r time}
ny_by_time <- ny %>%
  group_by(TIME)%>%
  reframe(death = sum(death), BORO = BORO)%>%
  mutate(Hourly = death)%>%
  select(Hourly, TIME, BORO)%>%
  ungroup()
  
ny_by_time <- unique(ny_by_time)
ny_by_time

ny_by_time%>%
ggplot(aes(x = TIME, y = Hourly, color = BORO, group= BORO))+
    geom_line() +
    scale_color_brewer(palette="Accent")+
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
   labs(title = "Time of Death", y = NULL)
```

Pictured above is the graph for the count of deaths at each time of day, visualizing the time of day with the highest deaths due to gun violence in New York.

We create a prediction model for the yearly cases and deaths in new york and visualize the model. 

From the analysis we can see that the Boro does affect the death rate due to shooting incidents. For example we can see that brooklyn has a higher rate of death on average than the whole of new york and other boros.

Models
```{r models}
mod <- lm(deaths_per_year ~ cases_per_year, data = ny_by_year)
mod

ny_by_year_pred <- ny_by_year %>% mutate(pred = predict(mod))
ny_by_year_pred

ny_by_year_pred %>% ggplot() + 
  geom_point(aes(x=deaths_per_year, y = cases_per_year, color = "Actual"))+ 
  geom_point(aes(x=pred, y = cases_per_year, color = "Predicted"))
```

Bias:

In this project some sources of bias that I may have had are in the lethality of guns being high and the frequency of shooting incidents within certain Boros being higher and more lethal. In this case I chose to ensure that each boro was reported equally and the reported cases were not altered in any form to reflect the bias. The yearly cases and deaths reflected the lack of lethality that I previously thought with shooting incidents and also reflected the lower frequency of incidents per year than I anticipated. Some Biases included as well besides personal may be the inability to report the incident or the lack of motivation to report incidents due to the law and fear of retaliation.
